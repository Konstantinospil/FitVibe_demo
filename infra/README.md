# Infrastructure

The `infra` workspace defines how FitVibe is deployed, observed, and secured across environments. Assets are environment-agnostic so they can be reused locally, in staging, or in production.

| `observability/`               | Prometheus scrape configs and Grafana dashboards              |
| `scripts/`                     | Helper shell scripts for migrating, seeding, and rollbacks    |
| `security/policies/`           | Operational policies (password rotation, key management, ...) |

## Local Stack

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker/dev/compose.dev.yml up --build
```

This spins up Postgres, the backend, the frontend, and NGINX configured with the files under `infra/nginx/`.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `cd-prod.yml`, `security-scan.yml`) call into these assets to build Docker images and deploy them to the target environment. Whenever you change Dockerfiles or compose manifests, ensure the workflows continue to reference the correct filenames.

## Observability

- Prometheus scrape configuration lives in `observability/prometheus.yml`.
- Grafana dashboards (JSON) sit under `observability/grafana/dashboards/`.
  Import them into Grafana or configure your provisioning pipeline to load them automatically.

## Security Policies

Policies under `security/policies/` are markdown documents reviewed with the security team. Update them whenever security posture changes and reference them from `apps/docs/` where relevant.
