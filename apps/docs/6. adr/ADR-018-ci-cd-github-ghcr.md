# ADR-018: CI/CD with GitHub Actions and GHCR

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Author:** Reviewer  
**Cross-References:** PRD §7 Engineering Standards; PRD §5 NFRs (security/perf); TDD §9–§10 Build/Run/Deploy; QA §2–§14 CI gates (tests, perf, a11y, security)

---

## Context

We require a deterministic, secure, and budget-enforcing delivery pipeline. The PRD, TDD, and QA plan define mandatory stages (lint, type-check, unit/integration/E2E tests), performance/a11y/security gates, and containerized releases. This ADR standardizes the CI/CD implementation on **GitHub Actions** with **GHCR** for images, **OIDC** for cloud access, and signed/supported artifacts (SBOM, SLSA provenance).

---

## Decision

1. **Triggers & Branch Strategy**
   - **PRs to `main`**: run full CI (no deploy).
   - **Push to `main`**: run full CI + build images + publish canary tags.
   - **Release tags (`vX.Y.Z`)**: publish immutable images, SBOM, and provenance; deploy to staging → manual approval → production.
   - Protected branches with required checks; linear history via squash merges.

2. **Workflow Stages (Overview)**
   1. **Prepare**: checkout, setup Node LTS & pnpm, restore turbo/pnpm caches.
   2. **Static Quality**: `eslint --max-warnings=0`, `tsc -b` (project refs).
   3. **Unit Tests**: vitest/jest with JUnit + coverage (Codecov/upload). Thresholds enforced.
   4. **Integration Tests**: ephemeral Postgres/Redis via services; migrations/seeds per run.
   5. **E2E Tests**: Playwright against preview server; artifacts (screenshots, traces) uploaded.
   6. **Lighthouse/A11y**: CI audit; fail < **90** score; axe checks for WCAG AA violations.
   7. **Security**: dependency scan (OSV/GHAS), secret scan, **ZAP baseline (authenticated)**; fail on **High/Critical** CVEs or missing headers.
   8. **Perf (k6 smoke)**: gate on budgets (API **p95 < 300 ms**, LCP **< 2.5 s**) and on **>10% regression** vs baseline.
   9. **Build Containers**: multi-stage Dockerfiles for backend/frontend; SBOM (syft) and **SLSA provenance** generated.
   10. **Publish**: push images to **GHCR** (`ghcr.io/org/app:{sha,branch,semver}`); mark canary/stable appropriately.
   11. **Deploy**: staging auto-deploy on release tag; production requires **manual approval** and environment protections.
   12. **Post-Deploy Checks**: health probes, smoke tests, and rollback on failure.

3. **Artifacts & Supply Chain Security**
   - **SBOM** generated per image and attached to release.
   - **Provenance** (SLSA generator for GitHub) publishes attestations.
   - **Cosign** image signing (keyless via OIDC) and policy verification at deploy time.

4. **Secrets & Cloud Access**
   - Use **GitHub Environments** and **OIDC federation** for cloud credentials (no long-lived keys).
   - Secrets are rotated and scoped per environment; runners have minimal permissions.

5. **Caching & Speed**
   - **pnpm** and **turbo** caches keyed by lockfile + task graph.
   - **Docker layer cache** enabled with `--cache-from` for repeatable, fast builds.
   - Matrix jobs for Node versions where helpful (LTS + current) on CI-only lanes.

6. **Testing Data & Ephemeral Infra**
   - Compose services: Postgres, Redis, MinIO, Mailhog.
   - DB migrations/seeds executed anew per job; tests clean up state.
   - Artifacts (JUnit, coverage, Playwright traces, k6 results) uploaded for PR review.

7. **Policy Gates & Budgets**
   - **Fail build** when any gate is breached: lints/warnings, type errors, unit/integration/E2E failures, Lighthouse <90, ZAP High/Critical, perf budgets or **>10% regression**.
   - Required checks configured in branch protection to enforce gates.

8. **Releases & Rollbacks**
   - Semantic versioning with conventional commits + changesets.
   - **Blue/green or canary** supported via environment config; rollback = re-deploy previous tag.
   - Release notes include OpenAPI artifact links and migration notes.

9. **Observability & Notifications**
   - Publish test & audit summaries to PR comments.
   - On deployment, post release links, image digests, and SLO snapshot (latency, error rate).
   - Alerts wired to on-call for failed post-deploy checks.

10. **Compliance & Retention**
    - Retain logs and artifacts for ≥ 30 days (PR) and ≥ 180 days (release) as per policy.
    - Access controls applied to environments; audit trail maintained for approvals.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Reproducible, secure pipeline with explicit quality budgets.
- Faster feedback via caches and matrices; safer releases through canary + manual production gate.
- Strong supply chain controls (SBOM, provenance, signing).

**Negative / Trade-offs**

- Additional CI minutes for perf/a11y/security gates (intentional).
- Slight configuration complexity for OIDC and attestations.

**Operational**

- Keep lockfiles and base images updated; rotate caches; review budgets quarterly.
- Record baselines for perf to keep regression signal healthy.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option                | Description                | Reason Rejected                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Third-party CI        | CircleCI/GitLab            | GitHub-native reduces friction and integrates with GHCR and GHAS |
| Push-on-merge deploys | Auto prod on `main`        | Violates need for manual approval and staged verifications       |
| No SBOM/provenance    | Skip supply chain metadata | Fails compliance and traceability goals in PRD/TDD               |
