Recommended Team Allocation
Frontend Dev (Senior): 1 FTE for 8 weeks (Planner, Logger, Admin, Settings)
Backend Dev (Senior): 0.5 FTE for 8 weeks (Infrastructure, idempotency, optimization)
DevOps Engineer: 1 FTE for 6 weeks (Infra setup, CI/CD, monitoring)
QA Engineer: 0.5 FTE for 4 weeks (UAT, load testing, smoke tests)
Security Specialist: 0.25 FTE + external pentest vendor
Product Manager: 0.5 FTE (UAT, go/no-go, launch comms)
Total Cost Estimate: $180K - $250K (labor + infrastructure)

Quick Wins (Can Start Immediately)
Week 1 Day 1: Start Planner UI (longest lead time)
Week 1 Day 1: Provision managed PostgreSQL (long setup)
Week 1 Day 3: Settings page expansion (quick win, builds momentum)
Week 2 Day 1: Start Logger UI (parallel to Planner)
Week 3 Day 1: Admin dashboard shell (parallel to Planner/Logger)
Post-Launch Roadmap (Future Iterations)
Workout templates library (community sharing)
AI-powered form check (video analysis)
Wearable integrations (Garmin, Apple Watch)
Coaching features (client management for coaches)
Mobile apps (React Native)
This roadmap assumes:

2-week sprints with 20% buffer for unknowns
Parallel workstreams (frontend + backend + DevOps)
Staging environment mirrors production
MVP feature set (defer "nice-to-haves")
Critical path: Planner UI → Logger UI → Admin Dashboard → Infrastructure → Load Testing → Launch

Earliest realistic launch: Week 8 (best case)
Conservative estimate: Week 10 (with contingency)

Update Todos
Create detailed production readiness roadmap
The production readiness roadmap is complete. This gives you a detailed 8-week plan with 6 \* Phases covering:

Critical Path: Planner UI → Logger UI → Admin Dashboard → Production Infrastructure → Security Hardening → Launch

Key Highlights:

16 major activities with effort estimates, dependencies, and acceptance criteria
Conservative timeline: 8-10 weeks to production-ready MVP
Team recommendation: 1 senior frontend dev, 0.5 backend dev, 1 DevOps engineer, 0.5 QA
Estimated cost: $180K-$250K (labor + infrastructure)
Risk mitigation: Buffer time built in, parallel workstreams to accelerate delivery
The plan prioritizes user-facing features first (Planner/Logger give immediate value), then operational requirements (admin moderation tools), then infrastructure hardening for scale and reliability.
