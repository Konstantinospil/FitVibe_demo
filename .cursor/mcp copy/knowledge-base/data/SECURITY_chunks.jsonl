Purpose and Scope\n\nThis policy explains how the FitVibe platform protects member data, how we collaborate with the security community, and the minimum expectations for anyone building or testing the system. It complements the Product Requirements Document (`apps/docs/1. Product Requirements Document.md`) and Technical Design Document (`apps/docs/2. Technical Design Document.md`), which describe the underlying controls in detail.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Following guidance from GitHub's security policy recommendations and the security.txt standard, we will not initiate legal action if you:\n\n- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, service disruption, or destruction of data.\n- Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you.\n- Give us a reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure.\n- Comply with applicable laws.\n\n### Security.txt\n\nThe `/.well-known/security.txt` file is managed through the NGINX configuration (see `infra/nginx/`).

Secure Development Requirements\n\nAll maintainers and contributors must:\n\n- Enable multi-factor authentication on GitHub and any cloud accounts used for FitVibe.\n- Keep local environments patched and free of known malware.\n- Never commit secrets, access tokens, or personal data (use `.env` files listed in `.gitignore`).\n- Run `pnpm install`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm typecheck` before opening a pull request.\n- Follow the conventions documented in `apps/docs/project-structure.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\n- Use signed commits whenever possible (`git config --global commit.gpgSign true`)", "source_file": "../../docs/SECURITY.md", "category": "documentation", "chunk_index": 6, "token_count": 249, "hash_short": "f415d4eb", "version": 1.0, "title": "Security", "mtime": "2025-11-24T23:08:11.388729", "ingested_at": "2025-11-30T04:00:41.921977", "tags": ["documentation", "md"]}

Dependency and Supply-Chain Management\n\n- Automated dependency and vulnerability checks run via `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`.\n- Review third-party packages for licence compatibility and maintenance status before adding them.\n- Run `pnpm audit --prod` for production dependencies and address high severity findings promptly.\n- Frontend and backend images are built via CI (`.github/workflows/cd-prod.yml`) and scanned before release.\n- Verify downloads via checksums or signatures when adding binary dependencies to `infra/`.\n\n---\n\n## 9.", "source_file": "../../docs/SECURITY.md", "category": "documentation", "chunk_index": 7, "token_count": 219, "hash_short": "a85c48d4", "version": 1.0, "title": "Security", "mtime": "2025-11-24T23:08:11.388729", "ingested_at": "2025-11-30T04:00:41.921977", "tags": ["documentation", "md"]}
