## Context

Dashboards need quick aggregates (e.g., weekly volume, PRs, exercise counts). Computing these over raw `sessions` and `sets` on every page load is expensive and affects OLTP. We need **pre‑computed** aggregates with predictable refresh.

## Decision

Use **PostgreSQL Materialized Views** for:

- `analytics.session_summary` — per session aggregates (total volume, duration, avg RPE).
- `analytics.weekly_aggregates` — per user, per week KPIs (distance, time, volume, sessions).

### Refresh Strategy

- **Incremental on write (near‑real‑time)**: After successful commit of `core.sets`/`core.sessions`, enqueue a small job to refresh **only affected partitions** or **parameterized subsets** via **REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY** with filters (when feasible using helper tables).
- **Scheduled full refresh**: Nightly **02:00** UTC job to run `REFRESH ... CONCURRENTLY` for both views.
- **Staging tables**: Maintain `analytics.staging_changes(user_id, session_id, week)` fed by triggers or app events; refresh jobs read and clear this table.

### Indexing

- Create indexes on matviews for typical filters: `(user_id, week_start)` for weekly, `(user_id, session_id)` for session summary.

### Consistency

- Readers tolerate slight staleness; dashboards show `as of <timestamp>` from matview `last_refresh_at` column.

## Consequences

- Faster dashboards; reduced OLTP contention.
- Additional complexity (refresh jobs and staging).

## Alternatives Considered

- **On‑the‑fly views**: Simpler but slow under load.
- **External OLAP**: Future option; overkill for MVP.

## QA & Acceptance

- E2E tests: creating/updating/deleting sessions updates aggregates after refresh.
- Performance tests: dashboard queries p95 < 150 ms using matviews.

## Backout Plan

Disable incremental refresh and rely solely on nightly refresh; if still problematic, fall back to normal SQL views while we redesign.

## Change Log

- **1.0 (2025-10-13):** Initial proposal.
