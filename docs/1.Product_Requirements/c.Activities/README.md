# Activities

This folder contains activity files that define implementation tasks.

## Purpose

Each activity file documents a specific implementation task with its description, difficulty, dependencies, and links to related user stories.

## File Naming

Format: `E{N}-A{M}-{kebab-case-title}.md` (e.g., `E1-A1-profile-edit-api.md`)

## Difficulty Scale

- **1 - Trivial**: Simple bug fix, small refactor, documentation update
- **2 - Easy**: Straightforward feature, well-defined scope, minimal dependencies
- **3 - Medium**: Moderate complexity, some unknowns, multiple components
- **4 - Hard**: Complex feature, multiple integrations, architectural considerations
- **5 - Very Hard**: Major architectural changes, high risk, extensive refactoring

## Template

See [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) for the structure and required fields.

## Single Source of Truth

**IMPORTANT**: Activity files contain ONLY activity-level information. They link to user stories but do NOT embed story details. See [REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md](../REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md) for the SSOT principle.

## Index

See [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for a list of all activities.
