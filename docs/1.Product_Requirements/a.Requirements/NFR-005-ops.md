## Executive Summary

This non-functional requirement defines operations standards and constraints for the FitVibe platform.

Ensure platform availability and data protection through backups and monitoring.

## Business Context

- **Business Objective**: Ensure platform availability and data protection through backups and monitoring.
- **Success Criteria**: 99.0% monthly uptime, backups succeed nightly, and restore drills validate RTO/RPO.
- **Target Users**: All users (availability affects everyone)

## Traceability

- **PRD Reference**: PRD §Ops
- **TDD Reference**: TDD §Ops

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Availability

The system shall maintain high availability:

- **SLO**: Uptime ≥99.0% monthly
- **Outage Response**: Outages have RCA within 5 business days
- **Health Checks**: `/healthz` endpoint for monitoring (allowlisted, no sensitive data)
- **Read-Only Mode**: Read-only mode for maintenance (prevents all write operations)

### Backups

- **Automated Backups**: Nightly encrypted backups of all critical data
- **Backup Encryption**: Backups encrypted and verified
- **Backup Integrity**: Backup integrity checksums validated
- **Backup Rotation**: Retain 30 days daily, 12 months monthly

### Disaster Recovery

- **Restore Drills**: Monthly restore drills validate RTO≤4h/RPO≤24h
- **DR Procedures**: Disaster recovery procedures documented and tested
- **Data Integrity**: Restored data matches source; integrity verified
