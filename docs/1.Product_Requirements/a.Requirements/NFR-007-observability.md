## Executive Summary

This non-functional requirement defines observability standards and capabilities for the FitVibe platform.

Ensure comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities to support operational excellence, debugging, and performance optimization.

## Business Context

- **Business Objective**: Provide comprehensive observability to enable rapid issue detection, debugging, and performance optimization.
- **Success Criteria**: All system components are observable with structured logs, metrics, and traces that support operational needs.
- **Target Users**: Engineering team, Operations team, Support team

## Traceability

- **PRD Reference**: PRD §5.6 (Observability)
- **TDD Reference**: TDD §Observability, §Monitoring

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Logging

The system shall provide comprehensive logging:

- **Structured Logging**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Log Levels**: Support for debug, info, warn, error, fatal
- **PII Exclusion**: No PII in logs beyond hashed IDs
- **Log Aggregation**: Logs aggregated to centralized system (Loki or filebeat-compatible)
- **Log Retention**: Log retention policy configured (default 30 days)

### Metrics

- **Prometheus Metrics**: Metrics exposed in Prometheus format
- **HTTP Metrics**: Request duration, status codes, throughput
- **Database Metrics**: Query duration, connection pool usage
- **Frontend Metrics**: LCP, FID, CLS (Core Web Vitals)
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, session completions, points awarded
- **Metric Cardinality**: Bounded cardinality to prevent explosion

### Tracing

- **OpenTelemetry**: Use OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for distributed tracing
- **Trace Context**: Trace context propagated across services
- **Sampling**: Configurable sampling rate (default 10% normal traffic, 100% errors)
- **Trace Collection**: Traces sent to Tempo or compatible backend

### Dashboards

- **Grafana Dashboards**: Dashboards for API latency, error rates, DB health, job queues
- **Auto-Refresh**: Dashboards refresh automatically
- **Data Retention**: Data retention configured appropriately

### Alerting

- **Alert Rules**: Alerting rules for critical metrics (5xx spikes, latency breaches, DB pool saturation)
- **Alert Channels**: Alerts sent to appropriate channels (PagerDuty, Slack, email)
- **Alert Routing**: Alert routing based on severity

## Related Epics

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Logging library (Pino)
- Prometheus client
- OpenTelemetry SDK
- Grafana
- Loki or log aggregation system
- Tempo or trace backend

### Feature Dependencies

- All system components must emit logs, metrics, and traces

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Log retention default 30 days
- Metric cardinality bounded
- Trace sampling rate configurable
- Alert fatigue prevented

### Business Constraints

- Observability must not impact performance
- Logs must not contain PII

## Assumptions

- Observability tools are reliable
- Teams understand how to use observability data
- Alerting is properly configured

## Risks & Issues

- **Risk**: Observability overhead may impact performance
- **Risk**: Log storage may grow very large
- **Risk**: Alert fatigue may occur

## Open Questions

- What is the acceptable observability overhead?
- How should we handle high-cardinality metrics?
