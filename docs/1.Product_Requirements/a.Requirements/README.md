# Requirements

This folder contains individual requirement files (Functional Requirements - FR, and Non-Functional Requirements - NFR).

## Purpose

Each requirement file documents a single requirement with its business context, dependencies, constraints, and links to related epics.

## File Naming

- Functional Requirements: `FR-XXX-{kebab-case-title}.md`
- Non-Functional Requirements: `NFR-XXX-{kebab-case-title}.md`

## Template

See [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) for the structure and required fields.

## Single Source of Truth

**IMPORTANT**: Requirement files contain ONLY requirement-level information. They link to epics but do NOT embed epic details. See [0.REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md](../0.REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md) for the SSOT principle.

## Index

See [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for a list of all requirements.
