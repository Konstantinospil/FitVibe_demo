## Criterion

{Specific, testable condition with measurable criteria (SMART) - ONLY this AC's information}

**SMART Criteria Checklist**:

- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Can be verified objectively (e.g., response time ≤500ms, coverage ≥90%)
- **Achievable**: Realistic within project constraints
- **Relevant**: Directly relates to the user story
- **Time-bound**: Includes timing constraints where applicable (e.g., "within ≤500ms", "within 24h")

**Example Good AC**: "Users can edit alias, weight, fitness level, and training frequency via API endpoint PATCH /api/v1/users/me within ≤500ms response time."

**Example Bad AC**: "Users can edit their profile." (Too vague, not measurable)

## Test Method
