# 1. Vision

> **Editor’s note (SSOT):** Detailed **technology** and **CI/CD** mechanics have moved to the **Technical Design Document (TDD)**.
> In this PRD, §6 and §11.2/§11.3 are placeholders that point to TDD. Functional _what/why_ content remains here.

FitVibe is a platform, where users can upload and plan training sessions expanding over all domains of fitness (vibes). Each vibe is represented as an element and users are challenged to maintain a balance of the elements by training holistically over all vibes.

| Vibe         | Element | Activities                                          |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Earth   | Lifting, strongman, body building                   |
| Agility      | Air     | Juggling, climbing, bouldering, gymnastics, parkour |
| Endurance    | Water   | Running, hiking, cycling, rowing, jump rope         |
| Explosivity  | Fire    | Sprints, jumps, throws                              |
| Inteligence  | Shadow  | Chess, shooting, sailing                            |
| Regeneration | Aether  | Yoga, Stretching, Fasting                           |

### 1.1 Goals

The plattform enables individuals to **plan, log, share, and track** their training sessions with a clear, accessible, and responsive interface independent of their fitness activity. Further, the logic gives them the ability to log exercises and make them comparable.

### 1.2 Tech Vision

The system is designed with a **modular, scalable architecture** and strict **separation of concerns**, ensuring sustainable growth and easy extensibility (e.g., nutrition tracking, wearables integration, AI recommendations).

The system shall follow a **security-first design** and guarantee full **GDPR compliance**, including privacy-by-default settings and user-controlled data management.
Accessibility shall be central, following **WCAG 2.1 AA standards**, providing a barrier-free experience across devices and user groups.

## 4. Functional Requirements (FR)

> Each FR includes **Acceptance Criteria (AC)** and, where relevant, **Error Behaviors (EB)**.

#### FR-1 User Management & Security

- **Registration** with verified email (15-minute TTL token, 3 resend/hour, auto-purge in 7 days).
  - **AC:** Duplicate usernames rejected (case-insensitive).
- **Login** with username/password; optional 2FA (TOTP + backup codes).
  - **EB:** Generic error messages, no user enumeration.
- **Password policy:** ≥12 chars, must include upper, lower, number, symbol.
- **Brute force protection:** max 10 failed attempts → exponential backoff, lock, optional CAPTCHA, user notified.
- **Logout** invalidates refresh session (rotated per use, revoked by `jti`).
- **Password reset** via single-use link (15 min TTL, audit logged).
- **Account deletion (GDPR):** hard deletion within 30 days (with exceptions for audit/legal); queued deletion from backups.
- **Data export:** JSON of profile, sessions, exercises, points (link valid 24h).

- Anti-gaming: bounds checking, device/IP heuristics; manual admin adjustments logged.

#### FR-7 Sharing & Community

- Authenticated feed of public sessions with search/sort.
- Clone public sessions into planner (attribution preserved).
- Reporting & moderation placeholders (future admin UI).
- **Policy:** default privacy is private; community guidelines apply.

#### FR-8 Internationalization (i18n)

- **Language Detection**: The system shall detect the user's preferred language via browser headers or stored profile preference.
- **Static UI Translation**: All visible system UI elements shall be translated using predefined token dictionaries (JSON resources).
- **Fallback**: If a translation for a token or text is unavailable, the system shall display the original English text.
- **Locale Formatting**: Dates, numbers, and units shall follow the selected locale conventions.
- **User Preference Persistence**: The user's preferred language shall be stored in their profile and applied on login.
