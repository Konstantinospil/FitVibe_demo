## Criterion

Database backups are encrypted using AES-256 encryption. Backup scripts include encryption configuration, and backup restore procedures work correctly with encrypted backups.

**SMART Criteria Checklist**:

- **Specific**: Database backups encrypted with AES-256
- **Measurable**: Encryption verified via backup file inspection and restore testing
- **Achievable**: Standard backup encryption (pg_dump with encryption, encrypted storage)
- **Relevant**: Data protection for backups
- **Time-bound**: Applied to all backups

## Test Method

Ops review verifies backup encryption is configured. Restore testing confirms encrypted backups can be restored correctly.

## Evidence Required

- Backup scripts with encryption configuration
- Encrypted backup file verification
- Restore test results with encrypted backups
- Documentation for backup encryption procedures

## Verification

- [ ] Criterion is specific and measurable
- [ ] Test method is appropriate
- [ ] Evidence requirements are clear
