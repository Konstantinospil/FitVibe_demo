## Criterion

Encryption at rest performance impact is measured and documented. Performance degradation is ≤5% compared to unencrypted storage (measured via database query benchmarks).

**SMART Criteria Checklist**:

- **Specific**: Performance impact ≤5% for encryption at rest
- **Measurable**: Benchmark results comparing encrypted vs unencrypted performance
- **Achievable**: Standard encryption overhead is typically 2-5%
- **Relevant**: System performance and user experience
- **Time-bound**: Measured before and after encryption implementation

## Test Method

Performance benchmarks measure database query performance with encrypted vs unencrypted storage. Results documented.

## Evidence Required

- Performance benchmark results (before and after encryption)
- Query performance metrics (p95, p99 latencies)
- Documentation of performance impact
- Performance monitoring dashboards

## Verification

- [ ] Criterion is specific and measurable
- [ ] Test method is appropriate
- [ ] Evidence requirements are clear
