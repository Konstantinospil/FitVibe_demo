## Criterion

SSL connection failures are logged with appropriate error messages and monitored. Connection attempts without SSL in production are rejected with clear error messages.

**SMART Criteria Checklist**:

- **Specific**: SSL connection failures logged and monitored, non-SSL connections rejected in production
- **Measurable**: Log entries for SSL failures, monitoring alerts configured
- **Achievable**: Standard logging and monitoring setup
- **Relevant**: Security monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Time-bound**: Continuous monitoring

## Test Method

Integration tests verify SSL connection failures are logged correctly. Monitoring setup verified via ops review.

## Evidence Required

- Log entries showing SSL connection failures
- Monitoring alerts configuration
- Error messages for non-SSL connection attempts
- Documentation for SSL troubleshooting

## Verification

- [ ] Criterion is specific and measurable
- [ ] Test method is appropriate
- [ ] Evidence requirements are clear
