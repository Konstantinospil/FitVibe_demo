# Epics

This folder contains epic files that group related activities and user stories.

## Purpose

Each epic file documents a major feature or capability, its business value, and links to related activities and user stories.

## File Naming

Format: `E{N}-{kebab-case-title}.md` (e.g., `E1-profile-and-settings.md`)

## Template

See [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) for the structure and required fields.

## Single Source of Truth

**IMPORTANT**: Epic files contain ONLY epic-level information. They link to activities and stories but do NOT embed their details. See [REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md](../REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md) for the SSOT principle.

## Index

See [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for a list of all epics.
