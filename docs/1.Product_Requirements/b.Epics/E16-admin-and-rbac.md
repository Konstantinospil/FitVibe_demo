This is a **legacy-completed epic**. It predates the current story-level traceability discipline and is retained as completed historical scope. Do not fabricate retrospective backlog stories solely to populate this section. New administrative capabilities that are not part of the completed E16 scope require a new story/epic or an explicit extension of a still-open requirement.
