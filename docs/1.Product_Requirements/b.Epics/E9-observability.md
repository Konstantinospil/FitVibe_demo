## Description

Provide comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities to support operational excellence, debugging, and performance optimization through structured logs, Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, Grafana dashboards, and alerting.

## Business Value

Enables rapid issue detection, debugging, and performance optimization. Observability is critical for maintaining system reliability and understanding system behavior in production.

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: Observability overhead may impact performance
  - **Mitigation**: Efficient instrumentation and sampling
- **Risk**: Log storage may grow very large
  - **Mitigation**: Retention policies and log rotation
- **Risk**: Alert fatigue may occur
  - **Mitigation**: Proper alert routing and severity levels
