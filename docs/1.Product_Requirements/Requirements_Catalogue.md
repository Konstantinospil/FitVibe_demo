# FitVibe Requirements Catalogue

**Version**: 3.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-09-25  
**Status**: Active

---

## Purpose

This catalogue is a synchronized navigation summary of the canonical requirement files in `a.Requirements/`. It is **not** an independent source of requirement status or scope. If this catalogue disagrees with an individual requirement file, the individual canonical file wins and the catalogue must be corrected.

The lifecycle for delivery artifacts is `Open → Progressing → Done`, with `Superseded` retained for historical traceability.
