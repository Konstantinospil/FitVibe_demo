## User Story

**As a** coach  
**I want** to modify exercise parameters (weight, exercise substitution, intensity/pace) when assigning training units  
**So that** I can personalize workouts for each athlete's level and needs

**Story Points**: 5

## Description

Coaches need the ability to modify exercise parameters during assignment to customize training units for individual athletes. This includes adjusting weight, substituting exercises, and modifying intensity/pace. These modifications apply only to the assigned session, not the original training unit template.

## Related Acceptance Criteria

{Note: Acceptance criteria will be created and linked here as they are defined}

## Dependencies

### Story Dependencies

- [US-12.2: Training Unit Assignment](./US-12.2-training-unit-assignment.md): Assignment must be functional before modifications
- [FR-010: Exercise Library](../a.Requirements/FR-010-exercise-library.md): Exercise substitution requires exercise library

### Feature Dependencies

- [FR-012: Coach Training Unit Assignment](../a.Requirements/FR-012-coach-training-unit-assignment.md): Parent requirement

## Technical Notes

- Weight modification: adjust weight for strength exercises per athlete
- Exercise substitution: replace exercises with alternatives (e.g., different equipment, difficulty level)
- Intensity/pace modification: adjust intensity or pace for endurance exercises
- Modification scope: changes apply only to assigned session, not training unit template
- Validation: ensure substituted exercises are valid and compatible
- Modification tracking: record all modifications with coach and timestamp

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for parameter modification logic
- Integration tests for modification API endpoints
- E2E tests for complete modification workflow
- Test weight adjustment functionality
- Test exercise substitution with validation
- Test intensity/pace modification
- Test that modifications don't affect original training unit

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Tests written and passing (≥80% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Parameter modifications work correctly
- [ ] Exercise substitution validated
- [ ] Modifications isolated to assigned sessions
