# User Stories

This folder contains user story files that define user-facing features.

## Purpose

Each user story file documents a user story with its "As a / I want / So that" format, story points, and links to related acceptance criteria.

## File Naming

Format: `US-{N}.{M}-{kebab-case-title}.md` (e.g., `US-1.1-profile-edit.md`)

## Story Points

Use Fibonacci scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

## Template

See [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) for the structure and required fields.

## Single Source of Truth

**IMPORTANT**: User story files contain ONLY story-level information. They link to acceptance criteria but do NOT embed AC details. See [0.REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md](../0.REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA.md) for the SSOT principle.

## Index

See [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for a list of all user stories.
