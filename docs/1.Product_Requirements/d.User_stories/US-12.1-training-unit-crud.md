## User Story

**As a** coach  
**I want** to create, view, edit, and archive training units  
**So that** I can build a reusable library of workout templates for my athletes

**Story Points**: 8

## Description

Coaches need the ability to perform full CRUD operations on training units. A training unit consists of a name, ordered list of exercises with sets, reps, distance, rest periods, and notes. Coaches can also specify that the entire exercise sequence should be repeated N times (1-100). Training units are private to the coach by default and can be archived (soft-deleted) to maintain historical data.
