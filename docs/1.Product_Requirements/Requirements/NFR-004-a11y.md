## Executive Summary

This non-functional requirement defines accessibility standards and constraints for the FitVibe platform.

Ensure platform is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Business Context

- **Business Objective**: Ensure platform is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Success Criteria**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, keyboard navigation works, and screen readers are supported.
- **Target Users**: All users, especially those with disabilities

## Traceability

- **PRD Reference**: PRD §A11y
- **TDD Reference**: VDS; QA

## Non-Functional Requirements

### WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance

The system shall comply with WCAG 2.2 AA standards:

- **Color Contrast**: Color contrast ≥4.5:1 for text, ≥3:1 for large text
- **Focus Indicators**: Focus visible on all interactive elements (2px outline, sufficient contrast)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All features navigable using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- **No Keyboard Traps**: No keyboard traps; skip links available
- **Screen Reader Support**: Screen-reader labels/roles present; no empty links/buttons
- **ARIA Usage**: ARIA only when necessary; semantic HTML preferred

### Accessibility Testing

- **Automated Testing**: axe-core tests run in CI; 0 critical issues across key pages
- **Manual Testing**: Manual sweeps for keyboard navigation and focus management
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Tested with VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS
- **Lighthouse**: Lighthouse accessibility score = 100

- axe-core library

### External Dependencies

- Screen reader software for testing

### Feature Dependencies

- All frontend features must be accessible

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Color contrast ≥4.5:1 for text
- Focus indicators ≥2px visible
- Lighthouse accessibility score = 100
- 0 critical axe violations

### Business Constraints

- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance required
- Accessibility must not degrade functionality

## Assumptions

- Users with disabilities will use assistive technologies
- Screen readers are properly configured
- Keyboard navigation is intuitive

## Risks & Issues

- **Risk**: Complex interactions may be difficult to make accessible
- **Risk**: Third-party components may not be accessible
- **Risk**: Dynamic content may confuse screen readers

## Open Questions

- Should there be accessibility training for developers?
- How should we handle complex interactions?
