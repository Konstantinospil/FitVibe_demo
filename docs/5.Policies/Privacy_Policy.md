  To create and manage your account, provide the Services you request, and support your use of FitVibe.
- **Consent:**  
  For example, when:
  - you opt‑in to marketing emails or push notifications,
  - you make certain content publicly visible,
  - you connect third‑party integrations or enable optional analytics and cookies where required by law.  
    You may withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.
- **Legitimate interests:**  
  To maintain and improve the security, performance, and usability of the Services; to prevent abuse; and to understand how the Services are used, provided that these interests are balanced against your rights and freedoms.
- **Legal obligations:**  
  To comply with accounting, tax, and regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests from public authorities.

## 8. How we share information

We do **not** sell your personal data.

We may share your personal data with:

- **Service providers and sub‑processors**  
  For example, providers of cloud infrastructure, email/SMS delivery, analytics, error reporting, and customer support tools. Each provider is bound by a data processing agreement requiring confidentiality, appropriate security measures, and, where applicable, Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”).
- **Integrations and partners you choose**  
  For example, if you connect a wearable device or calendar provider, we share only the data needed to enable that integration and only according to your configuration and the partner’s terms.
- **Organizations that provision your account**  
  If your account is created or managed by a coach, club, or employer, certain profile and activity data may be visible to designated administrators in accordance with their policies and our contracts with them.
- **Business transfers**  
  In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, where your data may be transferred as part of the transaction, subject to confidentiality and, where required, notice to you.
- **Legal and safety**  
  When necessary to comply with legal obligations, court orders, or lawful requests, or to enforce our terms and protect the rights, property, and safety of FitVibe, our users, or the public.
- **Aggregated or de‑identified data**  
  We may use or share aggregated or de‑identified information for analytics, research, or product improvement, provided it does not identify any individual.

## 9. International data transfers

FitVibe may process and store your personal data in countries other than the one in which you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your jurisdiction.

Where we transfer personal data from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland to countries that are not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection, we implement appropriate safeguards, such as:

- Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or UK authorities, and
- additional technical and organizational measures based on transfer impact assessments, where required.

You may request more information about these safeguards by contacting `kpilpilidis@gmail.com`.

## 10. Data retention

We retain personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to:

- provide the Services and features you have requested;
- fulfil the purposes described in this Policy;
- comply with our legal and contractual obligations; and
- resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

In particular, subject to change as our services evolve:

- **Account, training, and social graph data** are kept while your account remains active. When you request deletion of your account, we apply a short grace period (typically 7 days) and then delete or irreversibly anonymize associated data.
- **Backups** containing personal data are rotated and purged within a limited window (typically 14 days after the effective deletion), using an automated process designed to support data subject rights.
- **Authentication tokens, idempotency records, and moderation queues** are pruned on rolling schedules (for example, between 24 hours and 180 days), depending on operational needs and security requirements.
- **Audit logs and security logs** are retained for a bounded period (for example, 180 days) to support incident response and compliance.

When data is no longer required for these purposes, we either securely delete it or de‑identify it so that it can no longer be linked to you.

---

## 11. Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including:

- TLS (HTTPS) encryption in transit, with modern protocols and strict transport security;
- access controls and role‑based permissions in production environments, with multi‑factor authentication and use of a secrets manager;
- regular security updates, vulnerability management, and monitoring for anomalies;
- malware scanning for uploads, and audit trails for key administrative and security‑relevant actions.

No system can be completely secure. You remain responsible for choosing strong passwords, keeping them confidential, enabling multi‑factor authentication where available, and promptly notifying us of any suspected unauthorized access to your account.

---

## 12. Your rights

Depending on your place of residence and applicable law, you may have some or all of the following rights:

- **Access** – to obtain confirmation as to whether we process your personal data and receive a copy of that data.
- **Rectification** – to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data corrected.
- **Erasure** – to request deletion of your personal data, subject to certain exceptions (for example, where retention is required by law).
- **Restriction** – to request that we restrict processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.
- **Objection** – to object to processing based on legitimate interests and, where applicable, to object to direct marketing at any time.
- **Data portability** – to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine‑readable format and to transmit it to another controller where technically feasible.
- **Withdrawal of consent** – where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw it at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.
- **Complaint to a supervisory authority** – you may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you believe our processing infringes applicable law.

Residents of certain jurisdictions (for example, some U.S. states, Brazil, Canada) may have additional rights, such as rights to know, delete, or limit the use or disclosure of certain categories of information. These will be honored in accordance with the relevant statute.

You can exercise these rights by:

- using any self‑service tools provided in the app or account settings (for example, download or delete account functions), and/or
- contacting us at `kpilpilidis@gmail.com`.

We may need to verify your identity before acting on your request and may decline requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or otherwise not required or permitted by law.

## 13. Children’s data

The Services are **not directed to children under 16**, or any higher age set by applicable law in your jurisdiction for online consent.

- We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the applicable minimum age.
- If we learn that we have collected personal data from such a child without appropriate consent, we will delete it as soon as reasonably possible.

If you believe that a child has provided personal data to FitVibe in breach of this Policy, please contact us at `kpilpilidis@gmail.com`.

## 14. Health and fitness considerations

FitVibe provides training and wellness tooling. It is **not** a medical device and is **not** intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

Nothing in the Services constitutes medical advice. You should consult qualified healthcare professionals before starting or modifying any training program, especially if you have existing health conditions.

## 15. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example when we introduce new features, use new providers, or when laws or regulatory guidance change.

- For material changes, we will provide additional notice, such as an in‑app notification or email.
- The Policy is maintained in version control with historical versions retained for reference.

Your continued use of the Services after changes take effect constitutes your acknowledgment of the updated Policy.
