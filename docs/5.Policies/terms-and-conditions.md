- You are responsible for maintaining accurate account information and for safeguarding login credentials. Notify FitVibe immediately of unauthorized use.

## 2. License grant and intellectual property

- FitVibe grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the Services for personal or authorized organizational use in accordance with these Terms.
- The Services and all related intellectual property are owned by FitVibe and its licensors. No rights are granted except as expressly stated.

You agree not to:

- Reverse engineer, modify, or create derivative works of the Services except as permitted by law.

- You represent that you have the rights to share content you submit and that it does not violate the rights of others or applicable law.

## 5. Health and safety notice

- FitVibe provides training and wellness tools and does not provide medical advice. Consult a physician before beginning new training programs. Stop using the Services and seek medical attention if you experience adverse symptoms.

## 6. Third-party services and integrations

- Some features rely on third-party services (e.g., analytics, payment processors, device integrations). Your use of those services may be subject to their terms. FitVibe is not responsible for third-party services.

## 7. Fees and subscriptions

- If subscription or paid features are offered, pricing and billing terms will be presented in the Services. Taxes may apply. Payments are processed by third-party processors; you authorize FitVibe and processors to charge applicable fees.
- FitVibe may change pricing with reasonable notice, subject to applicable law. If you do not agree to changes, you may cancel before the new pricing takes effect.

## 8. Termination

- You may stop using the Services at any time. You may request account deletion as described in the Privacy Policy.
- FitVibe may suspend or terminate access for breach of these Terms, legal requirements, or to protect the Services or users. We may provide notice where feasible.

## 9. Disclaimers

- The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and accuracy. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusions of certain warranties, so these exclusions may not apply.

## 10. Limitation of liability

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FitVibe, its affiliates, and their officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising from your use of the Services or breach of these Terms.

## 12. Governing law and dispute resolution

- These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles, except where mandatory local law applies.
- Disputes should first be raised with FitVibe support. Where permitted by law, disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in Delaware on an individual basis, and you waive class actions. If arbitration is not permitted, disputes will be resolved in the courts located in Delaware. Consumers may have statutory rights to bring claims in their home jurisdictions; these Terms do not limit such rights.
