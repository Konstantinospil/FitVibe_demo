# FitVibe Legal Order

This document summarizes how the legal documents for FitVibe are organized and which terms take precedence. It complements the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Terms and Conditions/EULA.

## Purpose

- Provide a single entry point to the legal documentation used across the FitVibe services, including the FitVibe mobile and web applications used to plan training sessions, log workouts, and track progress.
- Clarify the order of precedence between the policies so users and administrators know which document governs specific topics.
- Identify governance practices for maintaining the documents.

## Document hierarchy

1. **Terms and Conditions / End User License Agreement (EULA)** — governs use of the FitVibe services, software licensing, acceptable use rules, and limitations of liability.
2. **Privacy Policy** — explains how personal data is collected, used, shared, and protected across the platform.
3. **Cookie Policy** — details cookie and similar technologies used on FitVibe sites and apps and how users can manage preferences.
4. **Service-Specific Notices** — any supplemental notices (for example, locale-specific disclosures) apply only to the extent they differ from or add to the above documents.

If there is a conflict between documents, the item with the lower number above controls unless a service-specific notice explicitly states otherwise or applicable law requires a different outcome.

## Applicability

- The documents are intended to be globally valid and align with common regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, ePrivacy, PIPEDA, and other regional standards.
- Localized supplements should be added in the relevant language and jurisdiction when FitVibe launches in new markets.

## Maintenance and versioning

- Each policy includes an "Effective Date" and a changelog section to record material updates.
- Updates that materially affect user rights should trigger in-product notifications and, where required, refreshed consent or acknowledgment.
- Archived versions should be retained to demonstrate compliance with applicable data protection and consumer protection laws.
