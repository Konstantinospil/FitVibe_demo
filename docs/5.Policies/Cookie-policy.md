This Cookie Policy explains how FitVibe uses cookies and similar technologies on our websites and applications. It should be read with the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions/EULA.

## 1. What are cookies?

Cookies are small files stored on your device when you visit a website or use a web-based application. They allow us to recognize your browser or device, remember preferences, and measure interactions. Similar technologies include local storage, SDK event logging, pixels, and beacons.

## 2. How we use cookies

- **Essential cookies:** enable core features such as authentication, account security, load balancing, and session management.
- **Preferences and functionality cookies:** remember your settings, language, and saved training views to provide a consistent experience.
- **Performance and analytics cookies:** help us understand usage, improve features, diagnose issues, and measure campaign effectiveness.
- **Advertising and marketing cookies:** if used, support remarketing, conversion measurement, and audience insights. Where required, these cookies are set only with your consent.

We may use third-party providers for analytics, performance monitoring, and marketing. These providers may set cookies or collect device identifiers when you use the Services. Their use is subject to their privacy policies. Current categories include hosting/CDN performance, product analytics, and crash diagnostics.

## 4. Managing cookies and preferences

- **Consent management:** Where required by law, we will request consent before setting non-essential cookies and provide controls to update preferences.
