# Shared Packages

The `packages` workspace contains reusable building blocks that are consumed by the FitVibe backend, frontend, and tooling. Each directory is a standalone PNPM workspace published (or versioned) together with the app code.

| Package          | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eslint-config/` | Shared ESLint configuration used across all workspaces  |
| `i18n/`          | Translation catalogues and helpers                      |
| `tsconfig/`      | Base TypeScript configuration files                     |
| `types/`         | Cross-cutting TypeScript type definitions               |
| `ui/`            | Reusable React UI primitives and design tokens          |
| `utils/`         | General-purpose helpers shared between backend/frontend |

Each package has its own `package.json` and can define scripts (build, lint, test) as needed. Use Turbo scopes or `pnpm --filter` to run tasks for a specific package.

```bash
pnpm --filter @fitvibe/utils test
pnpm --filter @fitvibe/ui build
```

When adding a new shared package, update this README and ensure it is referenced from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
